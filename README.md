This is a work in progress... really just wanted to throw it up here so I can continue working on it in the office on my work laptop tomorrow.

The pain point: asking / recieving code reviews then I / others are busy when the request comes and forget to follow up later.
The goal: a chrome extension to track and queue gerrit code reviews.
